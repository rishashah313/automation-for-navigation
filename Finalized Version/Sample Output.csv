MEDICAL CLEARANCE        Allergy Clinic   UAB Student Health Services(SHS) administers allergy immunotherapy (injections) as a service to our students. We do not provide allergy testing, mixing of extract(s), or immunotherapy education and instruction. The first shot from your extract MUST be performed by your allergist. SHS will store your extract(s) in a temperature-monitored refrigerator, administer your allergy shot under a physician\xe2\x80\x99s supervision, and provide emergency treatment in case of a reaction to your allergy shots.  Prior to receiving allergy injections at SHS, patients must be established with a SHS clinician, to review your medical history and medications. We require orders to be signed by your allergist and submitted to SHS by fax or mail. We DO NOT accept verbal orders for dosage adjustments. We may need to contact your allergist to clarify dosages or to request necessary information.  Before receiving allergy shots at SHS, we require your allergist to provide the requested information and to sign the UAB SHS \xe2\x80\x9cAllergy Injection Protocol and Consent\xe2\x80\x9d form. Please check with your Allergist to ensure that our request for information was received.   ALLERGY INJECTION PROTOCOL AND CONSENT FORM  ALLERGY INJECTION GUIDELINES     Allergy Clinic Hours  Appointment Procedure  Allergy Clinic Hours      Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday: 8:15am - 10:45am and 1:15am - 3:45pm.

The nurse will inspect the injection site(s) and record any local reaction. If you have a history of adverse reactions, you may be asked to wait longer.             Referrals   Students who have the SHIP must obtain a referral for all visits outside of Student Health Services (SHS). Visits for mental health, OB/GYN, and orthopedics do not require a referral. For students with private insurance coverage, referrals are offered as needed.   SHS has a full time coordinator to assist you with your needs.  Referrals are made as appropriate and within and outside the UAB Health System.  Most referral appointments or procedures are scheduled for you before you leave the office.

Prescription Services   All medical providers are licensed to write prescriptions, either printed on site and provided to the student at the time of the visit or sent electronically to the student\'s pharmacy of choice.

Refills of ongoing medications are best obtained during regular office visits. They can also be requested via the Patient Portal . For those patients who prefer to call, refill requests may be called in to our clinic nurse line by dialing (205) 975-7756. Please allow two business days for refill requests to be processed. For this reason, patients are encouraged to keep a close eye on their medications and to request refills in a timely manner. In most cases, regular refills will not be accepted by the on-call provider after office hours. We respectfully decline to refill routine medications during these interaction. If you need a refill prior to your next scheduled appointment, please log into your Patient Portal and send us a request through secure messaging, or call during normal business hours to request a refill. There are some prescriptions that cannot be refilled over the phone and may require an office visit with your primary care provider.
